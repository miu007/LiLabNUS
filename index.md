## Research Focus

Cells are the fundamental units of life. Replacing malfunctioning or degenerative tissues offers a promising path to restoring normal function and curing diseases once thought incurable. However, current cell and tissue therapies still face significant challenges.

At SynDevBio Lab, we strive to overcome these barriers by enhancing cells and multicellular structures through synthetic biology. We engineer cellular systems to decode the principles of developmental biology and pioneer next-generation regenerative therapies. By integrating synthetic biology, stem cell culture, and 3D models, we develop innovative platforms for studying cell fate, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery.

{% capture text %}

We engineer cell fate.
We reprogram somatic cells to a pluripotent, embryonic-like state.
We transform stem cells into embryo models to uncover the fundamental principles of early development.
We also generate functional cell types for applications in regenerative medicine.
